# ZeroName Electrum NMC

Use Electrum NMC to resolve .bit domain name.

## Development

```
cd plugins/ZeronameElectrumNMC
wget https://www.namecoin.org/files/electrum-nmc/electrum-nmc-3.3.10/Electrum-NMC-3.3.10.zip
```

The plugin should activated. Make sure you don't have `ZeronameLocal` enabled at the same time to avoid issues.
